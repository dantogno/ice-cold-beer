We made a physical prototype of the ramp and decided it will move along with two underlying "doodads" kind of like a shelf.
We know the shelf will have to eventually be fastened to the doodads, otherwise it will slide off.
No matter our solution to the slide-off problem, we need to create doodads that move up and down along with player input.
The first step is to just make one doodad that moves up and down with player input.
## What button should it be?
We know we're developing on mouse and keyboard, so no matter what platform we ultimately release the game on (PC, Xbox, iOS, etc), we have to have keyboard controls so that we can test the game as we develop it on PC.
Commonly games use WASD, or the arrow keys, so we could use use.
Another option could be up and down arrow on keyboard, left and right click on mouse.
In the interest of moving forward with development quickly, let's just go with WASD + arrow keys for now, and we can revisit usability down the road.
