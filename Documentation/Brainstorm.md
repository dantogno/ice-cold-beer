# Brainstorm
1. Player can use analog sticks on gamepad to emulate arcade joysticks.
1. We want to come up with a mouse and keyboard control scheme for players without gamepads!
1. Could work as a mobile game? What would the controls?
1. How can I customize the theme? My game is not going to be about ice cold beer unfortunately.
1. David wants us to make a first playable prototype as a top priority! Before we get carried away with art, and story stuff.
